Welcome to the Tox Developer site!
==================================

Tox is a secure and distributed Skype replacement.

At its heart it's a client dealing with our core library communicating
on our own protocol. All communications are encrypted using the peer
audited `NaCl` crypto library and this encryption can not be turned off.

Tox is powered by a distributed network which uses P2P connections for
chats between people, and unlike other Skype replacements, no federated
servers, centralized servers, or supernodes are used.
