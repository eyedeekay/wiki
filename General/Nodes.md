# Nodes (WIP)
In order to facilitate quick connections with other people using Tox, 
and to make life easier, Tox employs bootstrap nodes that each client 
connects to in order to retrieve a list of current clients connected 
to the pool. Below are a list of active nodes that you can use to 
connect to. For security reasons, this article is locked and only 
administrators can edit the list. If you have a node you want to add, 
please contact an admin. Want to help out by running a node?
