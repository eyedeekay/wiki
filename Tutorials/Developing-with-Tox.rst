Developing With Tox
===================

.. _developing_with_tox/c-is-for-core:

"C" Is For Core
---------------
The core of Tox is written in C. Don't know a lick of C?
Don't worry, that won't preclude you from using the Tox API.

.. _developing_with_tox/wrappers:

Tox has API wrappers in many languages
-------------------------------------
API bindings/wrappers are available for users of high-level languages
so they too can use the Tox API.
A list of available language wrappers for the Tox API:

* `SharpTox <https://github.com/Impyy/SharpTox>`_ *(C#)*
* `golibtox <https://github.com/codedust/go-tox>`_ *(Go)*
* `Tox4j <https://github.com/tox4j/tox4j>`_ *(Java)*
* `node-toxcore <https://github.com/saneki/node-toxcore>`_ *(Javascript)*
* `libtoxcore-racket <https://github.com/lehitoskin/libtoxcore-racket>`_ *(Racket)*
* `rstox <https://github.com/suhr/rstox/>`_ *(Rust)*

.. warning::
   These may not be 1-1 wrappers of API functions. You should read
   the documentation of your chosen wrapper for usage details.

Getting started in C
---------------------------------------
It's often easier to get to know the API in C to better understand it without wrapper abstractions.

Outdated wrappers
-------------------------------------
* `DeepEnd <https://github.com/stal888/DeepEnd>`_ *(Objective-C)*
* `PyTox <https://github.com/aitjcize/PyTox>`_ *(Python)*
* `haskell-tox-core <https://github.com/ollieh/haskell-tox-core>`_ *(Haskell)*
* `guile-toxcore <https://github.com/urras/guile-toxcore>`_ *(Guile)*
* `luatox <https://github.com/peersuasive/luatox/>`_ *(Lua)*
* `rust-tox <https://github.com/mahkoh/rust-tox/>`_ *(Rust)*
