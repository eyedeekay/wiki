Developing With Tox
===================

"C" Is For Core
---------------

The core of Tox is written in C. Don't know a lick of C? Don't worry,
that won't preclude you from using the Tox API.

Tox has API wrappers in many languages
-------------------------------------API bindings/wrappers are available
for users of high-level languages so they too can use the Tox API. A
list of available language wrappers for the Tox API:

-   [SharpTox](https://github.com/Impyy/SharpTox) *(C\#)*
-   [golibtox](https://github.com/codedust/go-tox) *(Go)*
-   [Tox4j](https://github.com/tox4j/tox4j) *(Java)*
-   [node-toxcore](https://github.com/saneki/node-toxcore)
    *(Javascript)*
-   [libtoxcore-racket](https://github.com/lehitoskin/libtoxcore-racket)
    *(Racket)*
-   [rstox](https://github.com/suhr/rstox/) *(Rust)*

> **warning**
>
> These may not be 1-1 wrappers of API functions. You should read the
> documentation of your chosen wrapper for usage details.

Getting started in C
--------------------

It's often easier to get to know the API in C to better understand it
without wrapper abstractions.

Outdated wrappers
